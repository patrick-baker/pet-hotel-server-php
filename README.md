# Pet Hotel Project

## General 
PHP is already installed. By typing "php -v" in the terminal, you can verify which version. PHP has its own built in server. To run the serfver, open the project directory, in the terminal and type "php -S localhost:5000".


## Things we learned
- PHP files allow you to type HTML alongside PHP tags.
- Within the same PHP file, variables/functions can be exchanged and shared between different PHP blocks.
- When making requests to the database, instead of hitting specific http routes, in PHP you hit files and carry information as params.
- In PHP, you don't need to specify between get, post, put, and delete. For example, in 'server/routes/editPet.php', pg_update is what defines the type of query method to perform.
- PHP is very succint. You can do a lot with very few lines of code. 


## Continuation
We would like to be able to build out the front end of the application in order to make the app full stack. The structure and workflow for PHP was very different from node and express which made the process more time consuming.
